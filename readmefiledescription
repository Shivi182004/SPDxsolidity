# Token Name: Bitcoin (BTC)

## Description

This smart contract implements a basic token functionality for a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin (BTC). It includes functionalities to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To integrate this smart contract into your project:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Place the contract code into your Solidity environment.

### Executing program

To use the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. *Minting Tokens:*
   To mint new tokens for an address, call the mint function with the address and the amount of tokens to mint.
   ```solidity
   function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
       totalSupply += _value;
       balances[_address] += _value;
   }
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
    if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_address] -= _value;
    }
}
